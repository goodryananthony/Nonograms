# Nonograms

A JavaFX based implementation of the logic/puzzle game Nonograms invented by Non Ishida. This implementation features a zoom scrollbar for increasing the size of small puzzles or decreasing the size of large puzzles. Also featured is click-and-drag functionality to select multiple squares at the same time.

This project started as an assignment for COMP 301 at UNC Chapel Hill, but all of the functionality is of my own design and surpasses any of the requirements for the original assignment.
